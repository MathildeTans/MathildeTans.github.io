excerpt: "Childhood stunting affects almost a quarter of all children under five worldwide. Aside from not reaching the (WHO) standard height for their age, stunted children are put at a disadvantage due to delayed cognitive and mental development. Recent studies tell us that maternal education can protect children from stunting. In this study, we quantify the global effect of maternal education on childhood stunting."

Childhood stunting affects almost a quarter of all children under five worldwide. Aside from not reaching the (WHO) standard height for their age, stunted children are put at a disadvantage due to delayed cognitive and mental development. Recent studies tell us that maternal education can protect children from stunting. In this study, we quantify the global effect of maternal education on childhood stunting.

For this study, we rely on data from the WHO Child Nutrition database and data from the World Bank. The data from the WHO is comprised of stunting prevalences from various studies around the world from the last 30 years. Some of these studies recorded the level of maternal education: no education, primary education, or secondary education. Commonly, an analysis into stunting takes the childrens' sex and age into account, as well as the area of residence (urban/rural/both). However, there is no variation in these variables in our cleaned dataset, hence we do not (have to) include age, sex, and area.
